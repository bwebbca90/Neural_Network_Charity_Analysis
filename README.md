# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview
purpose of the analysis

## Results
* What is considered the target for the model?
* What are considered to be the features for the model?
* What variables in the data are not features or targets and should be removed? 
* How many neurons, layers, and activation functions were selected for the neural network model, and why?
* Was target model performance achieved?
* What steps were taken to try and increase model performance?

## Summary
* recommendation for different model
